Features

Basic blockchain structure with proof-of-work
SHA-256 hashing
Block mining with adjustable difficulty
Chain validation
Genesis block creation
Simple string-based block data

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Java JDK 8 or higher
IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Java IDE

Installation

Clone the repository

bashCopygit clone [your-repository-url]

Open the project in your IDE
Run NoobChain.java to see the blockchain in action

Usage
javaCopy// Create and add blocks to the chain
Block genesisBlock = new Block("Genesis Block", "0");
blockchain.add(genesisBlock);

Block secondBlock = new Block("Second Block", genesisBlock.hash);
blockchain.add(secondBlock);

// Validate the chain
boolean isValid = NoobChain.isChainValid();
Core Components
Block Class

Stores block data
Handles block hash calculation
Implements proof-of-work mining

StringUtils Class

Provides SHA-256 hashing functionality
Contains utility methods for hex conversion
Handles string manipulation for blockchain operations

NoobChain Class

Main blockchain implementation
Manages the chain of blocks
Implements chain validation
Demonstrates basic blockchain operations

Customization
You can modify the mining difficulty by changing the difficulty variable in NoobChain.java:
javaCopypublic static int difficulty = 4; // Increase for more difficult mining

Inspired by basic blockchain concepts and Bitcoin
Built for educational purposes to understand blockchain technology

Future Improvements

 Add transaction support
 Implement wallet functionality
 Add networking capabilities
 Create a more sophisticated consensus mechanism
 Add support for smart contracts
 Implement merkle trees for transaction validation

Security Considerations
This is a basic implementation for learning purposes. It should not be used in production without significant security enhancements.
